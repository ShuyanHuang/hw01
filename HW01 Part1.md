### Deviant aggressive behavior

#### 1.

If Theory I was correct, social policies that motivate school enrollment and improve family education would be appropriate to reduce deviant aggressive behavior. Since it's important to discourage aggressive behavior by rewarding socially acceptable behavior and punishing deviant aggressive behavior, school is an ideal place for children to learn good behavior from experience, where they constantly receive feedback of their behavior from teachers. So by motivating school enrollment, more children can benefit from teachers' guidance. Furthermore, teacher training programs would also be effective, because they build up teachers' skills of appropriately rewarding and punishing students. Besides, family education also plays a key role in children's behavior building. Therefore, community programs that help parents to actively involve in children's behavior formation would help prevent deviant aggressive behavior. Also, government intervention is need when parents are showing deviant aggressive behavior and their children are receiving false feedback.

If Theory II was correct, public mental health support would be appropriate to reduce deviant aggressive behavior. By providing psychological counseling to people who lead a stressful life, hostility towards personal authority figures can be elimitated, and thus deviant aggressive behavior can be prevented before people get so frustrated as to show dangerous behavior.

If Theory III was correct, it would be helpful to eliminate social discriminations and policies should shift towards the discriminated groups. Social rules that discriminate among people should be corrected by laws, public education, and social campaigns, so that people would feel comfortable to conform to social rules. However, it is difficult to make social rules completely fair in a short time, which requires the government to temporarily compensate the currently discriminated groups so that they wouldn't become too unsatisfied with the society.

Finally, if Theory IV was correct, policies that aims to eliminate deviant subcultures and cultural segregation would be appropriate to reduce deviant aggressive behavior. According to Theory III, people show deviant aggressive behavior because of the need to be socialized within a deviant subculture. So the fundamental way to prevent such behavior is to eliminate such subcultures and build a positive cultural environment. And to prevent such subcultures from emerging, there should be efforts to improve inter-cultural communication so that subcultures wouldn't deviate too far away from the mainstream social norm.

**Mass Shootings**

Over the years, a vast majority of Americans are urging stricter background checks for gun buyers because of constant terrible mass shootings happening in this country. Some studies about people's attitudes towards background checks reveal what people think of as the main factors of deviant aggressive behavior such as shooting innocent people. For example, a survey conducted by Barry et al. (2013)[1] found that "eighty-five percent of respondents supported requiring states to report to the national background-check system persons who are prohibited from having guns because they have either been involuntarily committed to a hospital for psychiatric treatment or been declared mentally incompetent by a court", and that almost a half of them felt that people suffering serious mental illness were more deviant and dangerous than the general population. These findings show that most people support Theory II, believing that deviant aggressive behavior is largely due to mental anomaly. However, some studies are against this view. Metzl, MacLeish (2015)[2] found that "fewer than 5% of the 120,000 gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness". While mental illness might not be a key factor in mass shootings, other factors like extreme anger can also drive people to shoot, according to psychologist Stephen Ross[3]. These factors also support Theory II.

Theory I is also advocated by many scholars. A finding closely related to Theory I is that family structure plays an important role in crime, especially in the case of mass shootings. For example, criminologists Michael Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi found that “such family measures as the percentage of the population divorced, the percentage of households headed by women, and the percentage of unattached individuals in the community are among the most powerful predictors of crime rates”[4]. This finding is closely related to Theory I because abnormal family structures can lead to loss of family education, where the reward-punishment mechanism plays a key role in preventing deviant aggressive behavior.

Evidence for Theory III, however, is complicated. In 2016, a gunman killed 49 people on Sunday morning at a gay nightclub in Orlando. But it's unclear whether the gunman carried out the killings due to hatred for LGBT people, or because he himself was part of the LGBT community. His friends and family claimed that he hated gay people, while he had frequented this gay nightclub many times and used gay dating apps.[5]

Others believe that the rise of modern American mass shooting is the product of deviant subcultures. After Columbine school shooting, sociologist Ralph Larkin argued that "Harris and Klebold laid down the 'cultural script' for the next generation of shooters" by building their website, making movies starring themselves as hit men, and writing manifestos.[6] 

In general, Theory III and Theory IV are less discussed and researched than Theory I and Theory II in the case of mass shooting, because the latter two are more common.

## Waiting until the last minute

#### a.

To explain why people tend to do things at the last minute, I refer to subjective and objective reasons. 

Subjective reasons for procrastination include lack of self-confidence, low self-worth, and impatience. Many people don't get down to things until the last minute because they are not confident that they will do these things well. Some students may be afraid of writing a paper because they are afraid of screwing up and getting a bad grade. A related factor is low self-worth. Some people think too much before they actually do things, which is due to their pursuit for perfection, a byproduct of low self-worth. They value perfection too much because it's the only thing that can bring them satisfaction with themselves. As a result, they think, plan, and worry to get things done perfectly until the last minute, when they have no time to carry our their perfect plan. The third kind of person put off things because they are impatient. They can't stand the long period between starting to do something and finishing it. They want the fulfillment of finishing tasks shortly after they begin doing things so they choose to start at the last minute.

Objective reasons are rooted in the characters of the tasks. A typical task that people tend to put off is long-term, uncertain, and difficult. Writting a paper and scientific research belong to this category. People are not willing to do this kind of task because they are more likely to fail and get no reward from doing it, and even if they succeed, the reward is too far away in the future. A more direct reason for procrastination is that people do not like the task and are forced to do it. In this case people get no reward after they finish it.

#### b.

Whether a person will postpone doing a task is determined by the following factors:

1. This person's level of self-confidence: generally, how confident is this person that he/she will do things successfully.
2. This person's level of self-worth: generally, what kind of accomplishment will make this person satisfied with himself/herself.
3. This person's level of patience: generally, how long is this person willing to wait until he/she gets rewarded for a task.
4. How much will this person get rewarded from this specific task, including physical reward and psychological reward, short-term and long-term reward.
5. How difficult the task is: how much effort should this person put in to finish this task.
6. How uncertain the task is: the variation of the possible reward from this task.
7. How long will the task take.

#### c.

An alternative model is one addtionally has environment variables as input. Some argue that stress from the outside environment will strengthen people's unwillingness to do things. Sometimes the harder other people push, the more reluctant someone is to do the task. Another observation of the effect of environment is that nowadays it's somewhat popular to say "I am a procrastinator". This phenomenon might further encourage people to postpone things since they realize that everyone else are also procrastinating. These observations introduce two more factors in the model:

8. The stress from the people around this person: this can originate from family's expectation, peer pressure, and superior's requirement.
9. How popular is procrastination around this person: what proportion of the person's friends claim themselves as procrastinators.

#### d.

In the first model, an important factor in the formation of procrastination is the reward from doing things. The tendency to procrastination varies with the amount, timing and uncertainty of reward, and how long is the person willing to wait for the reward. So a direct prediction would be that if we artificially introduced more reward in the process of doing things, we would be less likely to put off things until the last minute. Since people are more willing to get things done if they expect more reward, it would motivate people to start early if they could receive some reward additional to the reward brought by the task itself. For example, students might encourage themselves by saying "I will watch a movie after I finish my paper". On the other hand, it woud further motivate people to start early if they don't need to wait until they fully finish the task to receive the reward. Thus students might better encourage themselves by saying "I will go out for dinner after I finish the literature review of my paper".

Another prediction from the first model is that even for procrastinators, not all tasks are postponed to the last minute. Whether a task will be postponed depends on the reward brought by the task, the difficulty and uncertainty of it, and the time it requires. For example, someone who always hands in homework at the last minute might have no difficulty washing dishes immediately after dinner, since washing dishes is a much easier task and requires less time.

We can first predict from the second model that people in a more competitive environment would be more likely to procrastinate. This is because generally in a more competitive environment, people are experiencing from stress from peer pressure, superior's requirement, family's expectation and their own desire to win. For example, students in a better school, employees in a higher position might have higher pressure level due to the fierce competition around them, and thus are more likely to procrastinate.

Another prediction from the second model is that someone with few procrastinator friends would be more likely to procrastinate after he/she makes some new procrastinator friends, especially if they frequently talk about procrastination. According to the second model, the popularity of procrastination in the surrounding environment affects people's tendency to procrastination. When someone who once has few procrastinator friends makes some new procrastinator friends, and procrastination is often discussed in the new circle, he/she switches from an environment with low popularity of procrastination to one with high popularity of procrastination. Holding other factors constant, this person would postpone things more often.
